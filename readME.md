# Personal Dashboard

For this project I created a dashboard inspired by that of Momentum's and Google Chrome's default to practice making use of APIs. The dashboard makes use of the OpenWeatherMap, Unsplash and Coin Gecko APIs.

## Features

* If allowed by the user, the dashboard will display the user's current location and the weather along with an icon representing the weather. I used Font Awesome to source icons and a switch statement which checks the current weather description in data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the appropriate icon
* The dashboard shows the current price of Dogecoin in GBP, this information is pulled from the Coin Gecko API
* The current time is displayed, I have used setInterval() to run every 0.5 seconds to ensure time is up to date and time is not lost
* I have used the Unsplash API to display a different background image each time the browser is refreshed, credit is given to the image's author which is linked towards the bottom of the page, the user can click the link which opens a new window and directs the user to the author's Unsplash profile - if a background image cannot be reached an alternative background image is used so the background does not remain blank
* Page layout has been made responsive so adjusts depending of the size of the viewport
